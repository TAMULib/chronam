New York Times Co. vs. Tasini,which clarifies that online newspapers presented in context, with the full page formatting intact, are acceptable, while individual, article-by-article presentation is not.  The written permission of any copyright and other rights holders is required for distribution,

<p>The first newspaper produced by Texas A&amp;M was the <em>Texas Collegiate</em> which ran from 1876-1880 under the direction of the Stephen F. Austin and Calliopean Literary Societies.  Another newspaper was not produced until 1889, which went by the name <em>The College Journal</em>, and was published monthly until 1893 by the Stephen F. Austin and Calliopean Literary Societies.  <em>The Battalion</em> started production in 1893 as a monthly publication by the Stephen F. Austin and Calliopean Literary Societies until 1906 when publication was taken over by the Student Association.  <em>The Battalion</em> is the longest running student newspaper at Texas A&amp;M, having been continuously published since 1893 with the exception for a short period in 1918 during World War I.  From 1947-1951 freshmen housed at the Annex (Riverside/RELLIS) produced a newspaper called <em>The Little Battalion</em>.  <em>The Daily Bulletin</em> began publication in 1916 by the Publicity Department of the College.  From 1918-1919 it ran under the name <em>Reveille</em> before switching back to <em>The Daily Bulletin</em> in 1919 and ceased publication in 1938.</p>
